# Day_004_Rock_Paper_Scissors

This project is part of my 100 Days of Code journey.

## Project Description

This project implements a classic Rock Paper Scissors game. It introduces fundamental Python concepts essential for building interactive command-line applications. Key areas covered include:

- **Random Module:** Utilizes `random.randint()` to enable the computer to make a random choice, ensuring unpredictable gameplay.
    
- **Conditional Statements:** Employs `if`, `elif`, and `else` constructs extensively to define the game's logic and determine the winner based on the choices made by the player and the computer.
    
- **ASCII Art:** Enhances the user experience by displaying simple ASCII art representations of Rock, Paper, and Scissors, making the game more visually engaging.
    
- **User Input:** Captures and processes input from the user, allowing them to select their move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
    

The game prompts the user for their choice, then generates a random choice for the computer, and finally declares the winner according to the traditional rules of Rock Paper Scissors.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Musn0o/100_days_of_code.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    
    ```
    cd 100_days_of_code/Day_004_Rock_Paper_Scissors
    ```
    
3. **Run the Python Script:**
    
    ```
    python rock_paper_scissors.py
    ```

## Concepts Learned

- **Random Number Generation:** Understanding and applying the `random` module for introducing elements of chance.
    
- **Control Flow:** Mastering the use of `if/elif/else` statements to manage program execution based on conditions.
    
- **String Manipulation:** Working with multi-line strings to display formatted ASCII art.
    
- **Basic Game Logic:** Implementing rules and determining outcomes in a simple, interactive game environment.
