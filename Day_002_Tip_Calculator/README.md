# Day_002_Tip_Calculator

This project is part of my 100 Days of Code journey.

## Project Description

On Day 2, the focus was on building a practical **Tip Calculator**. This project helped solidify understanding of:

- **Data Types:** Working with different data types, including integers, floats, and strings, and performing type conversions.
    
- **Mathematical Operations:** Performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, division) to calculate the tip and total bill.
    
- **F-Strings:** Using f-strings for efficient and readable string formatting to display results to the user.
    
- **User Input:** Taking multiple inputs from the user, such as the total bill, desired tip percentage, and the number of people to split the bill.
    

The application calculates how much each person needs to pay when splitting a bill, including a chosen tip percentage.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Musn0o/100_days_of_code.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    
    ```
    cd 100_days_of_code/Day_002_Tip_Calculator
    ```
 
 
3. **Run the Python Script:**
    
    ```
    python tip_calculator.py
    ```


## Demo

```
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $150.00
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 5
Each person should pay: $33.60
```

## Concepts Learned

- **Type Conversion:** Converting input strings to numerical types (`float`, `int`) for calculations.
    
- **Arithmetic Operators:** Applying operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` for practical problem-solving.
    
- **Number Formatting:** Displaying numerical results with specific precision (e.g., two decimal places for currency).
    
- **User Interaction:** Designing a program that effectively prompts for and processes user input.
