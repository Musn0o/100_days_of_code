# Day_017_Quiz_Project

This project is part of my 100 Days of Code journey.

## Project Description

On Day 17, the focus was on building a **Quiz Project** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project reinforced and expanded my understanding of:

- **Classes and Objects:** Defining custom classes (`Question`, `QuizBrain`) to model real-world entities and their behaviors.
    
- **Attributes:** Storing data within objects (e.g., `text` and `answer` for a `Question`, `question_number` and `score` for `QuizBrain`).
    
- **Methods:** Defining functions that belong to objects and operate on their attributes (e.g., `next_question()`, `check_answer()` in `QuizBrain`).
    
- **Constructors (`__init__`):** Initializing object attributes when an object is created.
    
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods within classes to manage complexity.
    
- **Data Structures:** Using a list of dictionaries to store quiz questions and answers.
    
- **Loops:** Implementing a `while` loop to continue the quiz as long as there are questions remaining.
    
- **Conditional Statements:** Logic for checking user answers and updating the score.
    

The quiz presents questions one by one, checks the user's answer, and keeps track of their score, demonstrating a practical application of OOP in a small interactive program.

## How to Run

This project typically involves multiple Python files (e.g., `main.py`, `question_model.py`, `data.py`, `quiz_brain.py`). Ensure all files are in the same directory. For this demonstration, the code is combined into a single block.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Musn0o/100_days_of_code.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    
    ```
    cd 100_days_of_code/Day_017_Quiz_Project
    ```

3. **Run the Main Python Script:**
    
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

## Concepts Learned

- **OOP Fundamentals:** Practical application of classes, objects, attributes, and methods.
    
- **Modular Design:** Breaking down a larger program into distinct, interacting classes.
    
- **Quiz Logic:** Implementing the core mechanics of a question-and-answer game.
    
- **Data Handling:** Structuring and accessing question data.
    
- **User Interface (CLI):** Presenting questions and feedback clearly in a terminal.
