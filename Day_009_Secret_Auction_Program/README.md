# Day_009_Secret_Auction_Program

This project is part of my 100 Days of Code journey.

## Project Description

On Day 9, the focus was on building a **Secret Auction Program**. This project provided a great opportunity to practice and understand:

- **Dictionaries:** Using dictionaries to store key-value pairs, specifically bidder names and their corresponding bids.
    
- **Loops:** Employing `while` loops to repeatedly collect bids until all participants have entered their bids.
    
- **Functions:** Defining a function to find the highest bidder from the collected bids.
    
- **Conditional Statements:** Logic to determine the winner based on the highest bid.
    
- **Clearing the Console:** (Conceptual) Implementing a way to clear the screen between bids to maintain the "secret" nature of the auction.
    
- **User Input:** Taking names and bids from multiple users.
    

The program collects bids from multiple participants without revealing them to others, then announces the winner and their winning bid at the end.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://https://github.com/Musn0o/100_days_of_code.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    
    ```
    cd 100_days_of_code/Day_009_Secret_Auction_Program
    ```


3. **Run the Python Script:**
    
    ```
    python secret_auction.py
    ```

Welcome to the secret auction program.
What is your name?: Alice
What's your bid?: $120
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'.
yes
What is your name?: Bob
What's your bid?: $150
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'.
yes
What is your name?: Charlie
What's your bid?: $100
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'.
no
The winner is Bob with a bid of $150.
```

## Concepts Learned

- **Dictionary Operations:** Adding, accessing, and iterating through dictionary items.
    
- **Finding Maximum Values:** Iterating through a dictionary to find the highest value.
    
- **Program Flow Control:** Managing the sequence of operations in a multi-user scenario.
    
- **Simulating Real-World Scenarios:** Applying programming concepts to model a practical process like an auction.
