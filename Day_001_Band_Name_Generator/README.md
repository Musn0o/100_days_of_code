# Day_001_Band_Name_Generator

This project is part of my 100 Days of Code journey.

## Project Description

On Day 1, the focus was on creating a simple **Band Name Generator**. This introductory project helped in understanding fundamental Python concepts such as:

- **`print()` function:** Displaying output to the console.
    
- **`input()` function:** Taking user input from the console.
    
- **Variables:** Storing and manipulating data (strings in this case).
    
- **String Concatenation:** Combining multiple strings to form a new one.
    

The application prompts the user for the city they grew up in and the name of a pet, then combines these two inputs to suggest a unique band name.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Musn0o/100_days_of_code.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    
    ```
    cd 100_days_of_code/Day_001_Band_Name_Generator
    ```

3. **Run the Python Script:**
    
    ```
    python band_name_generator.py
    ```

## Demo

```
Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
What's the name of the city you grew up in?
London
What's your pet's name?
Fluffy
Your band name could be London Fluffy
```

## Concepts Learned

- **Basic I/O:** Interacting with the user through input and output.
    
- **String Manipulation:** Combining text data.
    
- **Variable Assignment:** Storing user-provided information.
    
- **Program Flow:** Executing commands sequentially.
