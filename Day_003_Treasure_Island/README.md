# Day_003_Treasure_Island

This project is part of my 100 Days of Code journey.

## Project Description

On Day 3, the focus was on building a text-based adventure game called "Treasure Island." This project provided a practical application for understanding and utilizing:

- **Conditional Statements:** Extensive use of nested `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to create branching storylines and guide the player through different paths based on their choices.
    
- **Logical Operators:** Implicitly or explicitly using logical flow to determine outcomes.
    
- **String Manipulation:** Handling user input as strings and comparing them to determine the next step in the adventure.
    
- **Print Statements:** Crafting engaging narratives and providing clear instructions and feedback to the user.
    

The game challenges the player to make a series of choices to navigate through a perilous journey, ultimately leading to either finding the treasure or meeting an unfortunate end.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Musn0o/100_days_of_code.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    
    ```
    cd 100_days_of_code/Day_003_Treasure_Island
    ```


3. **Run the Python Script:**
    
    ```
    python treasure_island.py
    ```


## Demo

```
Welcome to Treasure Island.
Your mission is to find the treasure.
You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"
left
You've come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across.
wait
You arrive at the island unharmed. There is an old house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose?
yellow
You found the treasure! You Win!
```

_(Note: The demo shows one possible winning path. Other choices lead to different outcomes.)_

## Concepts Learned

- **Nested Conditionals:** Building complex decision-making structures.
    
- **Flow Control:** Directing the program's execution based on user input.
    
- **Text-Based Interactivity:** Creating engaging narratives through simple command-line interactions.
    
- **Problem Solving:** Designing a game with multiple paths and outcomes.
