# Day_026_NATO_Alphabet

This project is part of my 100 Days of Code journey.

## Project Description

On Day 26, I built a **NATO Phonetic Alphabet** translator. This project demonstrates the use of **dictionary comprehension** to create a dictionary from a CSV file and then use it to translate a word into its NATO phonetic alphabet equivalent.

- **Read CSV:** The program reads the NATO phonetic alphabet data from a CSV file.
- **Create Dictionary:** It uses dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary where the letters are the keys and the NATO phonetic alphabet words are the values.
- **User Input:** Prompts the user to enter a word.
- **Translate:** Translates the word into a list of NATO phonetic alphabet words.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Musn0o/100_days_of_code.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    
    ```
    cd 100_days_of_code/Day_026_NATO_Alphabet
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
    
    ```
    pip install pandas
    ```

4. **Run the Main Python Script:**
    
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

## Demo

Upon running the script, you will be prompted to enter a word. The program will then output the NATO phonetic alphabet code for that word.

```
Enter a word: Hello
['Hotel', 'Echo', 'Lima', 'Lima', 'Oscar']
```

## Concepts Learned

- **Dictionary Comprehension:** A concise way to create dictionaries.
- **Pandas Library:** Reading and processing data from CSV files.
- **Error Handling:** Using `try` and `except` to handle invalid input.
- **List Comprehension:** A powerful tool for creating lists.
