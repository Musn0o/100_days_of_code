# Day_056_Name_Card_Project

  

This project is part of my 100 Days of Code journey.

  

## Project Description

  

On Day 56, the focus was on building a simple **Personal Name Card Website** using the **Flask** web framework. This project marked an important step in serving static web content and introduced:

  

1. **Rendering HTML Templates:** Using Flask's `render_template()` function to serve dynamic or pre-designed HTML files instead of hardcoding HTML strings in Python.

2. **Jinja Templating Engine:** Understanding the basics of Jinja2, the templating engine Flask uses, to inject dynamic data into HTML (though simple in this project, it's a foundational concept).

3. **Serving Static Files:** Correctly linking and serving static assets like CSS stylesheets and images from a designated `static` folder.

4. **Folder Structure for Flask:** Learning the standard Flask project structure with `templates` and `static` folders.

5. **Basic HTML & CSS:** Applying fundamental HTML for structure and CSS for styling to create a visually appealing personal card.

  

This project demonstrates how to create a basic, multi-file Flask application that serves a static webpage with styling, laying the groundwork for more complex web applications.

  

## How to Run
  

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```

git clone https://github.com/Musn0o/100_days_of_code.git

```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

```

cd 100_days_of_code/Day_056_Name_Card_Project

```


3. **Install Required Libraries:**

```

pip install Flask

```

4. **Run the Python Script:**

```

python main.py

```

  

## Demo

  

After running the `main.py` script, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

  

You will see a simple personal name card webpage, styled with CSS, displaying a profile picture, your name, a brief description, and social media links.

  

_(Note: The output is displayed in a web browser, not the console.)_
