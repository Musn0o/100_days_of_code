# Day_005_Password_Generator

This project is part of my 100 Days of Code journey.

## Project Description

On Day 5, the focus was on building a **Password Generator**. This project allowed me to practice and solidify my understanding of:

- **Lists:** Working with lists to store characters (letters, numbers, symbols) for password generation.
    
- **Loops:** Using `for` loops to iterate and build the password based on user-defined criteria.
    
- **Random Module:** Leveraging `random.choice()` and `random.shuffle()` to select random characters and randomize the order of the generated password, ensuring strong, unpredictable passwords.
    
- **User Input:** Taking multiple inputs from the user to determine the desired length and composition (number of letters, symbols, and numbers) of the password.
    
- **String Manipulation:** Concatenating characters to form the final password.
    

The application prompts the user for the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers, then generates a random, strong password based on these specifications.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://https://github.com/Musn0o/100_days_of_code.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    
    ```
    cd 100_days_of_code/Day_005_Password_Generator
    ```
    
    
3. **Run the Python Script:**
    
    ```
    python password_generator.py
    ```

## Demo

```
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password? 8
How many symbols would you like? 2
How many numbers would you like? 2
Here is your password: 9&dF!j5kP@
```

## Concepts Learned

- **List Manipulation:** Adding, accessing, and shuffling elements within lists.
    
- **Randomness:** Generating random elements from sequences and shuffling lists for increased unpredictability.
    
- **Iterative Development:** Building a complex output (password) step-by-step using loops.
    
- **Modular Design:** Breaking down the password generation into manageable parts (collecting characters, shuffling).
